I came to the US in July 1996 on a consulting assignment and had the first month to get accustomed to the US weather, culture, driving and everything else foreign (bill and checks, the reverse light switches, the wrong side driving, etc.) :-). I took that time to go to the Olympics (Atlanta, 1996) and watched a semifinal basketball game. Did consulting with EDS (Denver, CO), LDDS Worldcom (Jackson, Mississippi), MCI and finally ended up taking a full-time position with AOL in Dulles, VA, where I spent 8 years.

Graduated from Army college as a Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer in 2002 and decided against joining the Indian Army. <br />My final year project at Siemens Information Systems Ltd., on &lsquo;Fingerprint recognition systems&rsquo; exposed me to real business software and technological trends. There I worked on development of a biometric device based on fingerprint recognition using fuzzy logic. And after graduation I wanted put my efforts into transforming my project into a viable business product. However, after making consistent progress for six months, we ran out of finances to sustain and develop the business. Since I was a freshly minted engineer with little contacts, I found it difficult to meet our capital requirements. It was very disheartening but I had little options available. I realized the need to gain professional experience and work towards my goals with more intensity and maturity. With a view to achieving this, I joined Infosys Technologies Ltd. as a software engineer to gain real world experience and develop a network for my future aspirations. During my professional career in India and US since then, I worked extensively on challenging projects in wide range of companies and geography, involving different technologies and diverse teams and took responsibility to execute complex projects in a challenging and rich environment with different teams with a wide range of backgrounds and cultures. <br /><br />But the fascinating realm of business inside me never died. In May 2007, the entrepreneurial bug bit me again. This time I started an IT services company Profecialinks, with operations in India.

How is that for drama? I have a lot of happy memories growing up, the walls of which are casually painted with 8 years of war that claimed a million lives.<br /><br />In the aftermath, economic opportunities were wiped out, the country was facing a brain-drain and the boundaries of free-speech were continuing to collapse. My entertainment was studying math until 1992 when I was 12 and got my hands on the first PC I ever encountered, and then studying computer languages until I was 17.<br /><br />When I was 17 my family immigrated to Toronto, Canada, looking for a stable economy and education opportunities for my younger sister and me. Early in 1998 I had a blog and a social networking web site I created in ASP with a MS-Access back-end. I had many followers, but had no idea how to scale it. The world caught up and soon these innovations were yesterday's news.<br /><br />After two years of high school in Canada, I attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the Honors Computer Science program. I did a few internships and found myself also interested in Psychology. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and met all the requirements for a General Psychology degree. I also became a Canadian citizen during my education. I started to work locally for a while.<br /><br />Early in my career I knew that I wanted to have a high impact on the world. I decided that the first step in that direction was to practice what I had learned in a place with a large audience and good practices. I had an exhausting 7 hour technical interview with Microsoft and got accepted for a position as a Software Design Engineer. I packed my bags, said goodbye to friends and family, and moved to Seattle, Washington in 2006. This was swimming against the flow: in the post 9/11 world in the US, people of my birth place were not welcome at the border.<br /><br />In my two years at Microsoft, I learned a great deal about design, best practices and people. The amazing thing about it was the many people I could learn from, not just about work, but about a fulfilling personal life as well. I also discovered more about myself. I realized that besides a good challenge and high impact, I enjoy other things. I also enjoy things such as knowing most of the peers I work with, recognition for what I do, dealing with the market directly and improvement in skills beyond only the technical ones. After a lot of self-exploration, I realized that my place is probably in a smaller entrepreneurial environment where I can face the free market more directly and thrive and grow.<br /><br />In 2009 I packed my bags yet again and headed for Silicon Valley. Inspired by the essays of Paul Graham and moved by the democratic movement in my birth country of Iran, I knew I needed to be in the hub that commands change in the world. I wanted to be a part of it. Right before my move, I had a phone conversation with Dr. James Morris, then Dean of the faculty. Despite having only one month left until the last application deadline, he encouraged me to apply. I went into overdrive trying to prepare for the GMAT. One week before the deadline, I wrote the exam with my hands shaking and teeth grinding when choosing multiple choice answers. When I was done, I almost wanted to discard it and write it again, but time was short and I decided to submit. My eyes were open-wide when I saw the 760 score. I would advise anybody procrastinating about it to ""just do it"".<br /><br />The company down here that hired me out of Microsoft is Adify. It is a startup that creates Ad Networks. It's basically a market-place for advertisers and clusters of web publishers, brought together by brokers called Network Builders. Just before I joined, it was bought by Cox. It needed to expand, and since it is built on the Microsoft stack, the founders were interested in my background. Moving from a much bigger company back to a small one so far has been a very pleasant and growing change. Here I am, on the brink of the expansion of my company and also ready to learn software management with you guys from one of the best schools in the world.<br /><br />I'm very excited!</p>",,,,,,,707-726-2646,Google Voice,,,232,10,t,/ameen aa-ree-aa-na/,,,,,8,05/24/2011 22:50:38,05/21/2011 20:54:13,72.14.229.81,76.102.230.192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My undergrad institution is UC San Diego, where I completed a BS in Cognitive Science -- which is a cross-disciplinary degree, combining parts of Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, Anthropology, Neuroscience, and Linguistics.</p>
<p>I have been a programmer at the individual contributor level since getting my first ""real job"" out of UCSD. In order:</p>
<p>Synetics. Defense contractor. I did some work on <span><a title=""TalkToMe (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://info.sv.cmu.edu/do/edit/Main/TalkToMe?topicparent=Main.AdamMaass"">TalkToMe</a></span>, a project for the Department of Education. Then ACMS, where I was a very junior Oracle DBA doing work for Milstar.</p>
<p>ATAC. Federal contractor, contracts with NASA and the FAA. Mostly programming work with the Passenger and Baggage Flow Model. Object database and Java 1.0! Also spend some sysadmin time with our team located on Moffet Field. I forget which building it was, but CMUSV isn't the first time I've been on Moffet Field.</p>

My first web company, my first startup. Did work on the Java Delivery System. For a time after they went public, I was a millionaire (at least on paper).</p>
<p>-- laid off for 3 months --</p>
<p>Fresher Information. Object database. Interesting technology, but boy the marketplace was cold and/or indifferent to what we had to offer. Only 9 months here and they had to lay me off.</p>
<p>-- 16 months laid off --</p>
<p>Ejasent, acquired by Veritas, merged into Symantec. Utility computing space. My project was about collecting statistics off the machines in a server farm so that usage-based billing and/or chargebacks could be made.</p>
<p>Snapfish (a unit of HP). Online digital photography.</p>

<li style=""background-color: transparent;"">Develop a sound understanding of software management in the context of entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainability - use that knowledge as a stepping stone towards my future goals</li>
<li style=""background-color: transparent;"">Make some great friends and a network of like-minded people who I can share my goals with and perhaps realize my future ambitions with</li>
<li style=""background-color: transparent;"">Have fun while doing all this !!! And of course, as promised in my introduction during orientation, be prepared to give a small piano recital at graduation !</li>
</ol>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">What I'm looking forward to about my educational experience is the opportunity to learn and understand the concepts of software business management not just from the perspective of the authors or the faculty but also from the rich and diverse perspectives of all my cohorts and team-mates. I am also very excited about learning new methodologies and tools that I can directly apply to my daily work. But most of all, I am looking forward to all the exciting team work and collaboration that makes learning so much more meaningful and fun, and the lifelong bond of knowledge and friendship it helps foster !</p>

Now an all-boys school might not sound as much fun as a co-ed one, but for those of you who have been in an all-boys (or all-girls) school, you know it can be a blast. And frankly, without the distraction of girls (or boys), I think one can really make strong, lifelong friends - and I have. Some of my best friends till date are from my early school days.</p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">My interest in computers and programming started early in school - thankfully, my school was one of the first schools to adopt computer based learning early on. I have been programming since middle school and went on to specialize in Computer Science in high school. I even topped my school in a high school exam scoring 99% - the highest ever score in computer science (at least it was the last time I checked)!!! I spent most of my time programming small games and tools in Pascal, C and later C++.</p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">The decision to pursue Engineering at an under-graduate level was more the result of social conditioning and career pressures - most IT and software companies at that time would only accept engineers at the entry-level and besides, in most middle-income circles like mine, a doctor and an engineer were the ""only paths to a successful life"" !!

For those of you in SV, you can find this store at Oakridge Mall and Valley Fair.

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">- Hands-on software development leadership in the areas of energy, healthcare, magazine distribution and corporate real estate</p>

When I set my mind on something, I strive to achieve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was offered direct entry into the second year of Software Engineering under the Accelerated Pathway of Engineering at the University of Auckland. A student in this pathway completes a four year engineering degree in just three years. I was also the Vice President of the Software Engineering Students Association.</p>
<p>While still at university, I came up with a solution to poverty &ndash; creating sustainable employment for artisans below the poverty line by guaranteeing a fair price for their handicrafts. The idea was to create a Facebook application &lsquo;Vital Gifts&rsquo; that showcased handicrafts made by artisans, utilizing the viral marketing capability of social networks to promote social gift giving. This idea won fourth place in the Microsoft Imagine Cup technology competition against more than 100 teams from all over New Zealand. I then co-founded a social venture, &lsquo;Vital Link Group&rsquo;, to continue working on the idea. As Chief Branding Officer and Software Engineer, my roles were diverse. I met a lot of professionals, presented in front of an audience of 700, and transformed from a student to a social entrepreneur in a matter of six months.</p>
<p>After completing my undergraduate education in Software Engineering, I began working as a Software Engineer at New Zealand's largest software exporter and health innovator - Orion Health. Along with my development role, I was also given the responsibility to work on the company&rsquo;s Development Standards, as well as the Quality Management System to fit the United States FDA regulations. Along with this, I was also Vice President Public Relations of the Orion Toastmasters club.</p>
<p>When I'm not busy chasing goals, I enjoy singing Carnatic classical and western music, creative writing - www.ghatikesh.com, painting, and everything artsy!</p>","<h2>About Me</h2>

After graduating I managed four restaurant concepts and learned my financials there.

We bounced around the country to various states including Maryland and Florida before finally settling down in Colorado. The one thing that helped me immensely during all of the moves was my love of sports (more specifically football.....er, soccer). I was able to meet a lot of great people through playing on various teams.</p>
<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in math from the University of Colorado in 2004 and went on to obtain my M.S. in Computer Science from CU as well. Professionally, I have been working for The Boeing Company since 2004. My career has been primarily in the software world and I have been fortunate to work on missile defense systems, R&amp;D, and satellites.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have been married to my high school sweetheart for 11 years and we have a beautiful little 20 month old that is hugely entertaining.</p>
