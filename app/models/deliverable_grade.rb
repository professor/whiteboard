# DeliverableGrade represents a studentâ€™s grade for a particular deliverable.
#
# Course -> Assignment -> Deliverable -> DeliverableGrade
#
# A course has many assignments.  Assignments are created by professors, and
# students submit their work to these assignments.  Each student can submit
# one deliverable for an individual assignment.  Similarly, each team can
# submit one deliverable for a team assignment.  Deliverables can be graded,
# and grades are represented through entries in the DeliverableGrade model.
# A deliverable grade is stored as an AES-encrypted string in DB, and it could be a number
# grade or a letter grade.
#
# Courses that are graded on percentages have scores that are out of 100, while
# courses graded on points are graded out of the total points for that
# assignment.
#
# Individual assignments: One deliverable grade for the creator of the
# deliverable
#
# Team assignments: One deliverable grade for each member in the team
#
# Unsubmittable assignments: One deliverable is used as a placeholder for
# each student in the course.  This will be created when the professor grades the
# assignment. Deliverable grades will be created for each student in the course when
# the deliverable is created.  Unsubmittable assignments are always individual assignments.
