# Deliverable is a zip or a file that the students submit for a course
#
# There are two ways for a student team to upload their deliverables.
#
# Way 1) On the curriculum pages for each task,  under the "Submitting Your Work" tab, there is a
# "submit your deliverable link" -- this gives the student the ability to name their deliverable, and upload a
# single attachment (i.e. one doc, ppt, or zip file). By default a Course Number and the Assignments are  provided for
# the student. Student needs to choose which asignment he/she is going to submit. The deliverable is individual or team
# deliverable will be checked on the basis of the assignment he/she is submitting. If a faculty member tries to do this,
# they won't see any courses lists since they aren't taking the course as a student.
# Students can submit only team deliverable and one individual deliverable per task, although they can update the
# attachment as many times as they like.
#
# Every member of a team can see team deliverables, only the individual can see their individual deliverable.
#
# Way 2) A student team can upload their deliverable by clicking on "My Deliverables" on the left hand navigation and
# select "New" at the bottom of the page. This is a little less efficient because the student needs to select a
# course and task number. It is a quick way for a student to see everything they have submitted for their courses.
#
# If a student or team accidentally uploads the wrong file, they can upload additional files. All files are
# kept in the system, but the convention is that the faculty will only examine the last uploaded file.
#
# The faculty assigned to that team will receive an email whenever a student submits a deliverable. The faculty
# can click on the email and provide either written comments in an text area or provide a file attachment back.
# If you annotate a word document you would upload the word document.
# If you annotate multiple files then you would attach a zip, just like the students do.
#
# If the faculty needs to see who has provided feedback or if they loose the email sent by the system, there is a f
# faculty interface for examining the deliverables. It is not perfect, it was developed by the students and they
# didn't have a strong sense of how we would use it. It currently shows all the deliverables submitted
# for a course sorted by recent changes first. There is no way to filter by faculty member, or sort by task,
# or sort by team, or sort by whether feedback has been provided. Control F in the browser is a life saver.
# It does show you which deliverables have been graded. In theory, just relying on the emails should be sufficient.
