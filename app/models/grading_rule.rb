# GradingRule represents the correspondence between points earned and letter grades. The mapping rule is given by the
# course instructor.
#
# GradingRule is configurable by clicking on "Configure course" in "Initial Course Configuration", both of which could
# be found on the index page of each course. In the configuration page, professor can choose grading criteria between
#   points and letter grades. If professor adopts letter grades, then professor needs to fill the table which maps out
#   point and letter grades.
#
# GradingRule follows the grading policy of CMU@SV. We provide the following options for letter grades: A, A-, B+, B,
#   B-, C+, C, C-. These grades can be configured by faculty by going to course configuration page. Beside these grades
#   faculty can also enter R, W, I grades. But these grades are not configurable.
#
# We provide the following functions to map out points and letter grades.
# * validate_letter_grade performs letter grade validation for the given score.
# * validate_score performs score validation for the given score by the grade type
# * format_score formats the given score
# * get_grade_in_prof_format convert points to
# * grade_type tells whether the deliverable is graded by weight or by points
# * A_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as A-
# * A_minus_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as A
# * B_plus_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as B+
# * B_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as B
# * B_minus_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as B-
# * C_plus_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as C+
# * C_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as C
# * C_minus_grade_min tells on or above this value the student will be marked as C
# * course_id tells the course for which this grading rule exists
# * is_nomenclature_deliverable tells which name is preferred by professor (deliverable or assignment)
