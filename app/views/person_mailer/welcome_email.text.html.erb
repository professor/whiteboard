We encourage everyone to forward their Andrew email account to their Silicon Valley email account by doing the following:

-On the right hand side of the screen, you'll see a section called "Email Forward"
-Click on Modify, at the form line "Forward email to:" enter your sv.cmu.edu email address, click Add, and Submit
-Mail forwarding will take effect immediately
-Email forwarding insures notifications from the university are received and Spam is properly blocked.

TWiki is our primary collaboration tool
----------------------------------------
We use TWiki, a wiki server, for our collaboration needs.  Faculty use the twiki to collaborate and share important information. Each course will have a twiki web and each student team is given a wiki web for sharing information among the team members.  You will receive a separate email with your twiki account information asking you to set your password.  All wiki words look SomethingLikeThis and we'll cover more about our TWiki server during your orientation. The url for the twiki is http://info.sv.cmu.edu -- Your twiki user name is "<%= @person.twiki_name %>"

Google Apps
------------
Google Apps is composed of a number of tools, including Docs, Calendar, Chat, Sites.
-<%= link_to "Email","http://gmail.sv.cmu.edu"%> is your primary communication tool between faculty, staff and students.
-<%= link_to "Docs", "http://docs.sv.cmu.edu"%> is used to occasionally share documents for immediate collaboration within small groups. (For long term and larger groups it's more appropriate to use TWiki)
-<%= link_to "Calendar", "http://calendar.sv.cmu.edu"%> is a must. It's used extensively for class/meeting planning, room reservations and various event planning. See <%= link_to "Google Calendars", "http://info.sv.cmu.edu/do/view/Public/GoogleCalendars"%> for directions on how to add in the Academic calendar.
-Chat is just another useful tool for immediate quick communication with other staff and classmates. You can also make voice and video calls with it.
-Sites can be used to quickly create a website for a small group of collaborators.

Adobe Acrobat Connect
---------------------
Adobe Acrobat Connect is an online meeting, collaboration and presentation tool. We use this tool in our classes to share slides and video feeds with our remote students. Distributed teams use this tool for team meetings (This tool is similar to WebEx and Livemeeting). You will receive an email when your account has been created.The url for adobe connect is http://cmusv.acrobat.com

Infrastructure requirements
---------------------------
We want every meeting participant to have the best possible experience. If you plan on attending a meeting or a class session remotely you need to have the proper tools. The number one complaint with remote attendees is fellow remote attendees calling in from noisy locations, talking on speaker phones, and not muting their phones. To ensure a clear connection and an effective meeting:
-Learn how to use your headset.
-Learn how to mute your line.
-Use a landline whenever possible.  Avoid using Skype.
-Do not use your laptop's internal microphone.
-Do not use a speaker phone.
-If your peers tell you that they can't hear you, it is your responsibility to do whatever it takes to remedy the situation which may include buying a different headset.  If you don't have a desk headset, we like the Plantronics S12. Cell phone headsets vary so much that we can't recommend one at this time.

Review the best practices document:
<%= link_to "http://info.sv.cmu.edu/do/view/Public/ConferenceCallBestPractices" %>
* Action required: I have the proper headset for my desk phone
* Action required: I have the proper headset for my cell phone
* Action required: My phone plan will allow me to participate remotely without resorting to Skype

(Just for students)
-------------------
Before you arrive, use the Graffiti web for collaboration. We have a twiki web that is designed for student use. We call it Graffiti. You can use that web however you want - from looking for housing in the Silicon Valley, putting on a student social event (e.g. paintball excusion, billards), etc.  For example, if you are looking for housing in the Silicon Valley area and want to talk about what you are finding with other people, create a twiki word in the Graffiti web, email out the word to yammer or a distribution list, and everyone just updates that twiki word. This is a twiki best practice, that way, there is one place to look for current status. <%= link_to "http://info.sv.cmu.edu/do/view/Graffiti/WebHome" %>
