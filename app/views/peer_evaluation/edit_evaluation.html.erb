<h1>Peer evaluation form completed by <%= @author.human_name %></h1>


<p>The goal of the Peer Evaluation Process is give you a chance to receive constructive feedback from your peers. As your team strives to become a high-performance team, it is important to communicate what is working well and what needs a little more improvement.</p>
<p>From the results of this form, faculty gain additional insight into how individual students contributed to the performance of the team. The results may affect your individual grade.</p>
<p>We don’t want rubber stamped answers. Carefully consider your teammates’ performance. Good answers are actionable and specific to the student. Please provide thoughtful, constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Instead of saying "Did not show any leadership skills" be clear about what the person can do. Here are some examples, "Encourage the team to have a high standard" or "Prepare meeting agendas to solve specific problems"</p>
<p>Do not use this as an opportunity to vent about frustrations that you should have brought up in person.</p>

<h2>Contribution Allocation</h2>
<p>In the table below, allocate 100 points among you and your group members that reflects each individual's effective contribution to all group work, including yourself.</p>
<p>Note that we are not interested in the amount of material produced. We are interested in quality contributions to the team. If a team member provided significant amount of material that needed to be reworked, then feel free to score accordingly.</p>
<p>Taking or adding a few points to anyone's score will not substantially affect their grade. Therefore, if a member did not contribute, you must clearly denote it by deducting an amount of points commensurate with the lack of participation.</p>
<br/>
<p>There are <%=@people.size%> members on this team. On average, each team member will receive <%=100 / @people.size unless @people.size == 0%> points. Please use whole numbers.</p>
