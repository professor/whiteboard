.SH "NAME"
Wget \- The non\-interactive network downloader.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
wget [\fIoption\fR]... [\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports \s-1HTTP\s0, \s-1HTTPS\s0, and \s-1FTP\s0 protocols, as
well as retrieval through \s-1HTTP\s0 proxies.
.PP
Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
.PP
Wget can follow links in \s-1HTML\s0, \s-1XHTML\s0, and \s-1CSS\s0 pages, to
create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the
directory structure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to
as \*(L"recursive downloading.\*(R"  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot
Exclusion Standard (\fI/robots.txt\fR).  Wget can be instructed to
convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for
offline viewing.
.PP
Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
download from where it left off.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.SS "Option Syntax"
.IX Subsection "Option Syntax"
Since Wget uses \s-1GNU\s0 getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are
more convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely
mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments.  Thus you may write:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-\-tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ \-o log
.Ve
.PP
The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
be omitted.  Instead of \fB\-o log\fR you can write \fB\-olog\fR.
.PP
You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-drc <URL>
.Ve
.PP
This is completely equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-d \-r \-c <URL>
.Ve
.PP
Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with \fB\-\-\fR.  So the following will try to download
\&\s-1URL\s0 \fB\-x\fR, reporting failure to \fIlog\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-o log \-\- \-x
.Ve
.PP
The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention
that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be useful to
clear the \fI.wgetrc\fR settings.  For instance, if your \fI.wgetrc\fR
sets \f(CW\*(C`exclude_directories\*(C'\fR to \fI/cgi\-bin\fR, the following
example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude \fI/~nobody\fR
and \fI/~somebody\fR.  You can also clear the lists in \fI.wgetrc\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-X " \-X /~nobody,/~somebody
.Ve
.PP
Most options that do not accept arguments are \fIboolean\fR options,
so named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no
(\*(L"boolean\*(R") variable.  For example, \fB\-\-follow\-ftp\fR tells Wget
to follow \s-1FTP\s0 links from \s-1HTML\s0 files and, on the other hand,
\&\fB\-\-no\-glob\fR tells it not to perform file globbing on \s-1FTP\s0 URLs.  A
boolean option is either \fIaffirmative\fR or \fInegative\fR
(beginning with \fB\-\-no\fR).  All such options share several
properties.
.PP
Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is
the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the
documented existence of \fB\-\-follow\-ftp\fR assumes that the default
is to \fInot\fR follow \s-1FTP\s0 links from \s-1HTML\s0 pages.
.PP
Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the \fB\-\-no\-\fR to
the option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the
\&\fB\-\-no\-\fR prefix.  This might seem superfluous\-\-\-if the default for
an affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way
to explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change
the default.  For instance, using \f(CW\*(C`follow_ftp = on\*(C'\fR in
\&\fI.wgetrc\fR makes Wget \fIfollow\fR \s-1FTP\s0 links by default, and
using \fB\-\-no\-follow\-ftp\fR is the only way to restore the factory
default from the command line.

Read URLs from a local or external \fIfile\fR.  If \fB\-\fR is
specified as \fIfile\fR, URLs are read from the standard input.  
(Use \fB./\-\fR to read from a file literally named \fB\-\fR.)
.Sp
If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command
line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input
file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to be
retrieved.  If \fB\-\-force\-html\fR is not specified, then \fIfile\fR
should consist of a series of URLs, one per line.
.Sp
However, if you specify \fB\-\-force\-html\fR, the document will be
regarded as \fBhtml\fR.  In that case you may have problems with
relative links, which you can solve either by adding \f(CW\*(C`<base
href="\f(CIurl\f(CW">\*(C'\fR to the documents or by specifying
\&\fB\-\-base=\fR\fIurl\fR on the command line.
.Sp
If the \fIfile\fR is an external one, the document will be automatically
treated as \fBhtml\fR if the Content-Type matches \fBtext/html\fR.
Furthermore, the \fIfile\fR's location will be implicitly used as base
href if none was specified.

When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an \s-1HTML\s0
file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
\&\s-1HTML\s0 files on your local disk, by adding \f(CW\*(C`<base
href="\f(CIurl\f(CW">\*(C'\fR to \s-1HTML\s0, or using the \fB\-\-base\fR command-line
option.

Resolves relative links using \fI\s-1URL\s0\fR as the point of reference,
when reading links from an \s-1HTML\s0 file specified via the
\&\fB\-i\fR/\fB\-\-input\-file\fR option (together with
\&\fB\-\-force\-html\fR, or when the input file was fetched remotely from
a server describing it as \s-1HTML\s0). This is equivalent to the
presence of a \f(CW\*(C`BASE\*(C'\fR tag in the \s-1HTML\s0 input file, with
\&\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR as the value for the \f(CW\*(C`href\*(C'\fR attribute.
.Sp
For instance, if you specify \fBhttp://foo/bar/a.html\fR for
\&\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR, and Wget reads \fB../baz/b.html\fR from the input file, it
would be resolved to \fBhttp://foo/baz/b.html\fR.

When making client \s-1TCP/IP\s0 connections, bind to \fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR on

Set number of retries to \fInumber\fR.  Specify 0 or \fBinf\fR for
infinite retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception
of fatal errors like \*(L"connection refused\*(R" or \*(L"not found\*(R" (404),
which are not retried.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-document=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-document=file"
.PD
The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
will be concatenated together and written to \fIfile\fR.  If \fB\-\fR
is used as \fIfile\fR, documents will be printed to standard output,
disabling link conversion.  (Use \fB./\-\fR to print to a file
literally named \fB\-\fR.)
.Sp
Use of \fB\-O\fR is \fInot\fR intended to mean simply "use the name
\&\fIfile\fR instead of the one in the \s-1URL\s0;" rather, it is
analogous to shell redirection:
\&\fBwget \-O file http://foo\fR is intended to work like
\&\fBwget \-O \- http://foo > file\fR; \fIfile\fR will be truncated
immediately, and \fIall\fR downloaded content will be written there.
.Sp
For this reason, \fB\-N\fR (for timestamp-checking) is not supported
in combination with \fB\-O\fR: since \fIfile\fR is always newly
created, it will always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be
issued if this combination is used.
.Sp
Similarly, using \fB\-r\fR or \fB\-p\fR with \fB\-O\fR may not work as
you expect: Wget won't just download the first file to \fIfile\fR and
then download the rest to their normal names: \fIall\fR downloaded
content will be placed in \fIfile\fR. This was disabled in version
1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are
some cases where this behavior can actually have some use.
.Sp
Note that a combination with \fB\-k\fR is only permitted when
downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert
all relative URIs to external ones; \fB\-k\fR makes no sense for
multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a single file;
\&\fB\-k\fR can be used only when the output is a regular file.
.IP "\fB\-nc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-clobber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-clobber"
.PD
If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's
behavior depends on a few options, including \fB\-nc\fR.  In certain
cases, the local file will be \fIclobbered\fR, or overwritten, upon
repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.
.Sp
When running Wget without \fB\-N\fR, \fB\-nc\fR, \fB\-r\fR, or
\&\fB\-p\fR, downloading the same file in the same directory will result
in the original copy of \fIfile\fR being preserved and the second copy
being named \fIfile\fR\fB.1\fR.  If that file is downloaded yet
again, the third copy will be named \fIfile\fR\fB.2\fR, and so on.
(This is also the behavior with \fB\-nd\fR, even if \fB\-r\fR or
\&\fB\-p\fR are in effect.)  When \fB\-nc\fR is specified, this behavior
is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of
\&\fIfile\fR.  Therefore, "\f(CW\*(C`no\-clobber\*(C'\fR" is actually a
misnomer in this mode\-\-\-it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the
numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the
multiple version saving that's prevented.
.Sp
When running Wget with \fB\-r\fR or \fB\-p\fR, but without \fB\-N\fR,
\&\fB\-nd\fR, or \fB\-nc\fR, re-downloading a file will result in the
new copy simply overwriting the old.  Adding \fB\-nc\fR will prevent
this behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved
and any newer copies on the server to be ignored.
.Sp
When running Wget with \fB\-N\fR, with or without \fB\-r\fR or
\&\fB\-p\fR, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy
of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the
file.  \fB\-nc\fR may not be specified at the
same time as \fB\-N\fR.
.Sp
Note that when \fB\-nc\fR is specified, files with the suffixes
\&\fB.html\fR or \fB.htm\fR will be loaded from the local disk and
parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-continue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--continue"
.PD
Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you
want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or
by another program.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls\-lR.Z
.Ve
.Sp
If there is a file named \fIls\-lR.Z\fR in the current directory, Wget
will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will
ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
length of the local file.
.Sp
Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the
current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior.
\&\fB\-c\fR only affects resumption of downloads started \fIprior\fR to
this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.
.Sp
Without \fB\-c\fR, the previous example would just download the remote
file to \fIls\-lR.Z.1\fR, leaving the truncated \fIls\-lR.Z\fR file
alone.
.Sp
Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \fB\-c\fR on a non-empty file, and
it turns out that the server does not support continued downloading,
Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the download to
start from scratch, remove the file.
.Sp
Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \fB\-c\fR on a file which is of
equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file
is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed
on the server since your last download attempt)\-\-\-because \*(L"continuing\*(R"
is not meaningful, no download occurs.
.Sp
On the other side of the coin, while using \fB\-c\fR, any file that's
bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
download and only \f(CW\*(C`(length(remote) \- length(local))\*(C'\fR bytes will be
downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can
be desirable in certain cases\-\-\-for instance, you can use \fBwget \-c\fR
to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data
collection or log file.
.Sp
However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
\&\fIchanged\fR, as opposed to just \fIappended\fR to, you'll end up
with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file
is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially
careful of this when using \fB\-c\fR in conjunction with \fB\-r\fR,
since every file will be considered as an \*(L"incomplete download\*(R" candidate.
.Sp
Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
\&\fB\-c\fR is if you have a lame \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy that inserts a
\&\*(L"transfer interrupted\*(R" string into the local file.  In the future a
\&\*(L"rollback\*(R" option may be added to deal with this case.
.Sp

.IX Item "--progress=type"
Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
indicators are \*(L"dot\*(R" and \*(L"bar\*(R".
.Sp
The \*(L"bar\*(R" indicator is used by default.  It draws an \s-1ASCII\s0 progress
bar graphics (a.k.a \*(L"thermometer\*(R" display) indicating the status of
retrieval.  If the output is not a \s-1TTY\s0, the \*(L"dot\*(R" bar will be used by
default.
.Sp
Use \fB\-\-progress=dot\fR to switch to the \*(L"dot\*(R" display.  It traces
the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of downloaded data.
.Sp
When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the \fIstyle\fR by
specifying the type as \fBdot:\fR\fIstyle\fR.  Different styles assign
different meaning to one dot.  With the \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR style each dot
represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.
The \f(CW\*(C`binary\*(C'\fR style has a more \*(L"computer\*(R"\-like orientation\-\-\-8K
dots, 16\-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K
lines).  The \f(CW\*(C`mega\*(C'\fR style is suitable for downloading very large
files\-\-\-each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a
cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).
.Sp
Note that you can set the default style using the \f(CW\*(C`progress\*(C'\fR
command in \fI.wgetrc\fR.  That setting may be overridden from the
command line.  The exception is that, when the output is not a \s-1TTY\s0, the
\&\*(L"dot\*(R" progress will be favored over \*(L"bar\*(R".  To force the bar output,
use \fB\-\-progress=bar:force\fR.

By default, when a file is downloaded, it's timestamps are set to

\&\fB\-\-timestamping\fR on subsequent invocations of wget. However, it
is sometimes useful to base the local file's timestamp on when it was

When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web \fIspider\fR,
which means that it will not download the pages, just check that they

.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the

Set the network timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  This is equivalent
to specifying \fB\-\-dns\-timeout\fR, \fB\-\-connect\-timeout\fR, and
\&\fB\-\-read\-timeout\fR, all at the same time.
.Sp
When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies
like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled by
default is a 900\-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0 disables
it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to
change the default timeout settings.
.Sp
All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
subsecond values.  For example, \fB0.1\fR seconds is a legal (though
unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking
server response times or for testing network latency.
.IP "\fB\-\-dns\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dns-timeout=seconds"
Set the \s-1DNS\s0 lookup timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  \s-1DNS\s0 lookups that
don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By default, there
is no timeout on \s-1DNS\s0 lookups, other than that implemented by system
libraries.
.IP "\fB\-\-connect\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--connect-timeout=seconds"
Set the connect timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  \s-1TCP\s0 connections that
take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default, there is no
connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.
.IP "\fB\-\-read\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--read-timeout=seconds"
Set the read (and write) timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  The
\&\*(L"time\*(R" of this timeout refers to \fIidle time\fR: if, at any point in
the download, no data is received for more than the specified number
of seconds, reading fails and the download is restarted.  This option
does not directly affect the duration of the entire download.
.Sp
Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection
sooner than this option requires.  The default read timeout is 900
seconds.
.IP "\fB\-\-limit\-rate=\fR\fIamount\fR" 4
.IX Item "--limit-rate=amount"
Limit the download speed to \fIamount\fR bytes per second.  Amount may
be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the \fBk\fR suffix, or megabytes
with the \fBm\fR suffix.  For example, \fB\-\-limit\-rate=20k\fR will
limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.
.Sp
This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in conjunction
with power suffixes; for example, \fB\-\-limit\-rate=2.5k\fR is a legal
value.
.Sp
Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified
by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the \s-1TCP\s0 transfer to slow
down to approximately the specified rate.  However, it may take some
time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be surprised if limiting
the rate doesn't work well with very small files.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w seconds"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-wait=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wait=seconds"
.PD
Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use of
this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time can be
specified in minutes using the \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR suffix, in hours using \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR
suffix, or in days using \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR suffix.
.Sp
Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the
destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to
reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry.  The
waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-random\-wait\*(C'\fR, which see.
.IP "\fB\-\-waitretry=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--waitretry=seconds"
If you don't want Wget to wait between \fIevery\fR retrieval, but only
between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.  Wget will
use \fIlinear backoff\fR, waiting 1 second after the first failure on a
given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on that
file, up to the maximum number of \fIseconds\fR you specify.
.Sp
By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.
.IP "\fB\-\-random\-wait\fR" 4
.IX Item "--random-wait"
Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs
such as Wget by looking for statistically significant similarities in
the time between requests. This option causes the time between requests
to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * \fIwait\fR seconds, where \fIwait\fR was
specified using the \fB\-\-wait\fR option, in order to mask Wget's
presence from such analysis.
.Sp
A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the fly.
Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to ensure
automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied
addresses.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-random\-wait\fR option was inspired by this ill-advised
recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to the
actions of one.

.PD
Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with \fBk\fR suffix), or
megabytes (with \fBm\fR suffix).
.Sp
Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if you
specify \fBwget \-Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls\-lR.gz\fR, all of the
\&\fIls\-lR.gz\fR will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several
URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input file.
Thus you may safely type \fBwget \-Q2m \-i sites\fR\-\-\-download will be
aborted when the quota is exceeded.
.Sp
Setting quota to 0 or to \fBinf\fR unlimits the download quota.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-dns\-cache\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-dns-cache"
Turn off caching of \s-1DNS\s0 lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the \s-1IP\s0
addresses it looked up from \s-1DNS\s0 so it doesn't have to repeatedly
contact the \s-1DNS\s0 server for the same (typically small) set of hosts it
retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget run will
contact \s-1DNS\s0 again.
.Sp
However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
short-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues a
new \s-1DNS\s0 lookup (more precisely, a new call to \f(CW\*(C`gethostbyname\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`getaddrinfo\*(C'\fR) each time it makes a new connection.  Please note
that this option will \fInot\fR affect caching that might be
performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer,
such as \s-1NSCD\s0.
.Sp
If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you probably
won't need it.
.IP "\fB\-\-restrict\-file\-names=\fR\fImodes\fR" 4
.IX Item "--restrict-file-names=modes"
Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during
generation of local filenames.  Characters that are \fIrestricted\fR
by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with \fB\f(CB%HH\fB\fR, where
\&\fB\s-1HH\s0\fR is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted
character. This option may also be used to force all alphabetical
cases to be either lower\- or uppercase.
.Sp
By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as
part of file names on your operating system, as well as control
characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful for
changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a
non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the
control characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only
those in the \s-1ASCII\s0 range of values.
.Sp
The \fImodes\fR are a comma-separated set of text values. The
acceptable values are \fBunix\fR, \fBwindows\fR, \fBnocontrol\fR,
\&\fBascii\fR, \fBlowercase\fR, and \fBuppercase\fR. The values
\&\fBunix\fR and \fBwindows\fR are mutually exclusive (one will
override the other), as are \fBlowercase\fR and
\&\fBuppercase\fR. Those last are special cases, as they do not change
the set of characters that would be escaped, but rather force local
file paths to be converted either to lower\- or uppercase.
.Sp
When \*(L"unix\*(R" is specified, Wget escapes the character \fB/\fR and
the control characters in the ranges 0\-\-31 and 128\-\-159.  This is the
default on Unix-like operating systems.
.Sp
When \*(L"windows\*(R" is given, Wget escapes the characters \fB\e\fR,
\&\fB|\fR, \fB/\fR, \fB:\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB"\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB<\fR,
\&\fB>\fR, and the control characters in the ranges 0\-\-31 and 128\-\-159.
In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses \fB+\fR instead of
\&\fB:\fR to separate host and port in local file names, and uses
\&\fB@\fR instead of \fB?\fR to separate the query portion of the file
name from the rest.  Therefore, a \s-1URL\s0 that would be saved as
\&\fBwww.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah\fR in Unix mode would be
saved as \fBwww.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah\fR in Windows
mode.  This mode is the default on Windows.
.Sp
If you specify \fBnocontrol\fR, then the escaping of the control
characters is also switched off. This option may make sense
when you are downloading URLs whose names contain \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters, on
a system which can save and display filenames in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (some possible
byte values used in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 byte sequences fall in the range of values
designated by Wget as \*(L"controls\*(R").
.Sp
The \fBascii\fR mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values
are outside the range of \s-1ASCII\s0 characters (that is, greater than
127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames
whose encoding does not match the one used locally.

Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With \fB\-\-inet4\-only\fR

records in \s-1DNS\s0, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in
URLs.  Conversely, with \fB\-\-inet6\-only\fR or \fB\-6\fR, Wget will
only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.
.Sp
Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an IPv6\-aware
Wget will use the address family specified by the host's \s-1DNS\s0 record.
If the \s-1DNS\s0 responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, Wget will try
them in sequence until it finds one it can connect to.  (Also see
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-prefer\-family\*(C'\fR option described below.)
.Sp
These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or
IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid debugging
or to deal with broken network configuration.  Only one of
\&\fB\-\-inet6\-only\fR and \fB\-\-inet4\-only\fR may be specified at the

.IP "\fB\-\-prefer\-family=none/IPv4/IPv6\fR" 4
.IX Item "--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6"
When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
with specified address family first.  The address order returned by
\&\s-1DNS\s0 is used without change by default.
.Sp
This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing hosts
that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4 networks.  For
example, \fBwww.kame.net\fR resolves to
\&\fB2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085\fR and to
\&\fB203.178.141.194\fR.  When the preferred family is \f(CW\*(C`IPv4\*(C'\fR, the
IPv4 address is used first; when the preferred family is \f(CW\*(C`IPv6\*(C'\fR,
the IPv6 address is used first; if the specified value is \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR,
the address order returned by \s-1DNS\s0 is used without change.
.Sp
Unlike \fB\-4\fR and \fB\-6\fR, this option doesn't inhibit access to
any address family, it only changes the \fIorder\fR in which the
addresses are accessed.  Also note that the reordering performed by
this option is \fIstable\fR\-\-\-it doesn't affect order of addresses of
the same family.  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses

Consider \*(L"connection refused\*(R" a transient error and try again.
Normally Wget gives up on a \s-1URL\s0 when it is unable to connect to the

to be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for instance, when 
you're mirroring a remote site that uses \fB.asp\fR pages, but you want 
the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another 
good use for this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A \s-1URL\s0 
like \fBhttp://site.com/article.cgi?25\fR will be saved as
\&\fIarticle.cgi?25.html\fR.
.Sp
Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time
you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local

.PD
Specify the username \fIuser\fR and password \fIpassword\fR on an

encode them using either the \f(CW\*(C`basic\*(C'\fR (insecure),
the \f(CW\*(C`digest\*(C'\fR, or the Windows \f(CW\*(C`NTLM\*(C'\fR authentication scheme.

Another way to specify username and password is in the \s-1URL\s0 itself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who
bothers to run \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR.  To prevent the passwords from being seen,
store them in \fI.wgetrc\fR or \fI.netrc\fR, and make sure to protect
those files from other users with \f(CW\*(C`chmod\*(C'\fR.  If the passwords are

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-http\-keep\-alive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-http-keep-alive"
Turn off the \*(L"keep-alive\*(R" feature for \s-1HTTP\s0 downloads.  Normally, Wget
asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you download
more than one document from the same server, they get transferred over
the same \s-1TCP\s0 connection.  This saves time and at the same time reduces
the load on the server.
.Sp
This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive)
connections don't work for you, for example due to a server bug or due
to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-cache"
Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the remote
server an appropriate directive (\fBPragma: no-cache\fR) to get the
file from the remote service, rather than returning the cached version.
This is especially useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date
documents on proxy servers.
.Sp
Caching is allowed by default.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-cookies\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-cookies"
Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining
server-side state.  The server sends the client a cookie using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Set\-Cookie\*(C'\fR header, and the client responds with the same cookie
upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the server owners to keep
track of visitors and for sites to exchange this information, some
consider them a breach of privacy.  The default is to use cookies;
however, \fIstoring\fR cookies is not on by default.
.IP "\fB\-\-load\-cookies\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--load-cookies file"
Load cookies from \fIfile\fR before the first \s-1HTTP\s0 retrieval.
\&\fIfile\fR is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
\&\fIcookies.txt\fR file.
.Sp
You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require
that you be logged in to access some or all of their content.  The login
process typically works by the web server issuing an \s-1HTTP\s0 cookie
upon receiving and verifying your credentials.  The cookie is then
resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so
proves your identity.
.Sp
Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved by
\&\fB\-\-load\-cookies\fR\-\-\-simply point Wget to the location of the
\&\fIcookies.txt\fR file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
cookie files in different locations:
.RS 4
.IP "Netscape 4.x." 4
.IX Item "Netscape 4.x."
The cookies are in \fI~/.netscape/cookies.txt\fR.
.IP "Mozilla and Netscape 6.x." 4
.IX Item "Mozilla and Netscape 6.x."
Mozilla's cookie file is also named \fIcookies.txt\fR, located
somewhere under \fI~/.mozilla\fR, in the directory of your profile.
The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
\&\fI~/.mozilla/default/\fIsome-weird-string\fI/cookies.txt\fR.

You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File menu,
Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been tested with Internet
Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions.
.IP "Other browsers." 4
.IX Item "Other browsers."
If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
\&\fB\-\-load\-cookies\fR will only work if you can locate or produce a
cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.

.RS 4
.Sp
If you cannot use \fB\-\-load\-cookies\fR, there might still be an
alternative.  If your browser supports a \*(L"cookie manager\*(R", you can use
it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're mirroring.
Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct Wget
to send those cookies, bypassing the \*(L"official\*(R" cookie support:
.Sp

.Ve
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-save\-cookies\fR \fIfile\fR" 4

Save cookies to \fIfile\fR before exiting.  This will not save cookies
that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called \*(L"session
cookies\*(R"), but also see \fB\-\-keep\-session\-cookies\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-keep\-session\-cookies\fR" 4
.IX Item "--keep-session-cookies"
When specified, causes \fB\-\-save\-cookies\fR to also save session
cookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they are
meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser.
Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit
the home page before you can access some pages.  With this option,
multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far as
the site is concerned.
.Sp
Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies,
Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget's
\&\fB\-\-load\-cookies\fR recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want
\&\fB\-\-save\-cookies\fR to preserve them again, you must use
\&\fB\-\-keep\-session\-cookies\fR again.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-length"
Unfortunately, some \s-1HTTP\s0 servers (\s-1CGI\s0 programs, to be more
precise) send out bogus \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Length\*(C'\fR headers, which makes Wget
go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot
this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on
the very same byte.
.Sp
With this option, Wget will ignore the \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Length\*(C'\fR header\-\-\-as
if it never existed.
.IP "\fB\-\-header=\fR\fIheader-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "--header=header-line"
Send \fIheader-line\fR along with the rest of the headers in each
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it
must contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain
newlines.
.Sp
You may define more than one additional header by specifying
\&\fB\-\-header\fR more than once.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        wget \-\-header=\*(AqAccept\-Charset: iso\-8859\-2\*(Aq \e

\&               http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
.Ve
.Sp
Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
previous user-defined headers.
.Sp
As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers otherwise
generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to connect to
localhost, but to specify \fBfoo.bar\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR header:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-\-header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/
.Ve
.Sp
In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of \fB\-\-header\fR caused
sending of duplicate headers.
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-redirect=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--max-redirect=number"
Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a resource.
The default is 20, which is usually far more than necessary. However, on
those occasions where you want to allow more (or fewer), this is the
option to use.

Specify the username \fIuser\fR and password \fIpassword\fR for
authentication on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`basic\*(C'\fR authentication scheme.

Security considerations similar to those with \fB\-\-http\-password\fR
pertain here as well.
.IP "\fB\-\-referer=\fR\fIurl\fR" 4

Include `Referer: \fIurl\fR' header in \s-1HTTP\s0 request.  Useful for

.IX Item "--user-agent=agent-string"
.PD
Identify as \fIagent-string\fR to the \s-1HTTP\s0 server.
.Sp
The \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
\&\f(CW\*(C`User\-Agent\*(C'\fR header field.  This enables distinguishing the
\&\s-1WWW\s0 software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as
\&\fBWget/\fR\fIversion\fR, \fIversion\fR being the current version
number of Wget.
.Sp
However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
the output according to the \f(CW\*(C`User\-Agent\*(C'\fR\-supplied information.
While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by
servers denying information to clients other than (historically)
Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer.  This
option allows you to change the \f(CW\*(C`User\-Agent\*(C'\fR line issued by Wget.
Use of this option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are
doing.
.Sp
Specifying empty user agent with \fB\-\-user\-agent=""\fR instructs Wget
not to send the \f(CW\*(C`User\-Agent\*(C'\fR header in \s-1HTTP\s0 requests.
.IP "\fB\-\-post\-data=\fR\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "--post-data=string"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-post\-file=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--post-file=file"
.PD
Use \s-1POST\s0 as the method for all \s-1HTTP\s0 requests and send the specified
data in the request body.  \fB\-\-post\-data\fR sends \fIstring\fR as
data, whereas \fB\-\-post\-file\fR sends the contents of \fIfile\fR.
Other than that, they work in exactly the same way. In particular,
they \fIboth\fR expect content of the form \f(CW\*(C`key1=value1&key2=value2\*(C'\fR,
with percent-encoding for special characters; the only difference is
that one expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other
accepts its content from a file. In particular, \fB\-\-post\-file\fR is
\&\fInot\fR for transmitting files as form attachments: those must
appear as \f(CW\*(C`key=value\*(C'\fR data (with appropriate percent-coding) just
like everything else. Wget does not currently support
\&\f(CW\*(C`multipart/form\-data\*(C'\fR for transmitting \s-1POST\s0 data; only
\&\f(CW\*(C`application/x\-www\-form\-urlencoded\*(C'\fR. Only one of
\&\fB\-\-post\-data\fR and \fB\-\-post\-file\fR should be specified.
.Sp
Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the \s-1POST\s0 data in
advance.  Therefore the argument to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-post\-file\*(C'\fR must be a regular
file; specifying a \s-1FIFO\s0 or something like \fI/dev/stdin\fR won't work.
It's not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in
\&\s-1HTTP/1\s0.0.  Although \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 introduces \fIchunked\fR transfer that
doesn't require knowing the request length in advance, a client can't
use chunked unless it knows it's talking to an \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 server.  And it
can't know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the
request to have been completed \*(-- a chicken-and-egg problem.
.Sp
Note: if Wget is redirected after the \s-1POST\s0 request is completed, it
will not send the \s-1POST\s0 data to the redirected \s-1URL\s0.  This is because
URLs that process \s-1POST\s0 often respond with a redirection to a regular
page, which does not desire or accept \s-1POST\s0.  It is not completely
clear that this behavior is optimal; if it doesn't work out, it might
be changed in the future.
.Sp
This example shows how to log to a server using \s-1POST\s0 and then proceed to
download the desired pages, presumably only accessible to authorized
users:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
\&        wget \-\-save\-cookies cookies.txt \e
\&             \-\-post\-data \*(Aquser=foo&password=bar\*(Aq \e
\&             http://server.com/auth.php
\&        
\&        # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
\&        wget \-\-load\-cookies cookies.txt \e
\&             \-p http://server.com/interesting/article.php
.Ve
.Sp
If the server is using session cookies to track user authentication,
the above will not work because \fB\-\-save\-cookies\fR will not save
them (and neither will browsers) and the \fIcookies.txt\fR file will
be empty.  In that case use \fB\-\-keep\-session\-cookies\fR along with
\&\fB\-\-save\-cookies\fR to force saving of session cookies.
.IP "\fB\-\-content\-disposition\fR" 4
.IX Item "--content-disposition"
If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support for
\&\f(CW\*(C`Content\-Disposition\*(C'\fR headers is enabled. This can currently result in
extra round-trips to the server for a \f(CW\*(C`HEAD\*(C'\fR request, and is known
to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not currently enabled by default.
.Sp
This option is useful for some file-downloading \s-1CGI\s0 programs that use
\&\f(CW\*(C`Content\-Disposition\*(C'\fR headers to describe what the name of a
downloaded file should be.
.IP "\fB\-\-trust\-server\-names\fR" 4
.IX Item "--trust-server-names"
If this is set to on, on a redirect the last component of the
redirection \s-1URL\s0 will be used as the local file name.  By default it is
used the last component in the original \s-1URL\s0.
.IP "\fB\-\-auth\-no\-challenge\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auth-no-challenge"
If this option is given, Wget will send Basic \s-1HTTP\s0 authentication
information (plaintext username and password) for all requests, just
like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.
.Sp
Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to support
some few obscure servers, which never send \s-1HTTP\s0 authentication
challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say, in addition to
form-based authentication.
.SS "\s-1HTTPS\s0 (\s-1SSL/TLS\s0) Options"
.IX Subsection "HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options"
To support encrypted \s-1HTTP\s0 (\s-1HTTPS\s0) downloads, Wget must be compiled
with an external \s-1SSL\s0 library, currently OpenSSL.  If Wget is compiled
without \s-1SSL\s0 support, none of these options are available.
.IP "\fB\-\-secure\-protocol=\fR\fIprotocol\fR" 4
.IX Item "--secure-protocol=protocol"
Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are \fBauto\fR,
\&\fBSSLv2\fR, \fBSSLv3\fR, and \fBTLSv1\fR.  If \fBauto\fR is used,
the \s-1SSL\s0 library is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate
protocol automatically, which is achieved by sending an SSLv2 greeting
and announcing support for SSLv3 and TLSv1.  This is the default.
.Sp
Specifying \fBSSLv2\fR, \fBSSLv3\fR, or \fBTLSv1\fR forces the use
of the corresponding protocol.  This is useful when talking to old and
buggy \s-1SSL\s0 server implementations that make it hard for OpenSSL to
choose the correct protocol version.  Fortunately, such servers are
quite rare.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-check\-certificate\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-check-certificate"
Don't check the server certificate against the available certificate
authorities.  Also don't require the \s-1URL\s0 host name to match the common
name presented by the certificate.
.Sp
As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's certificate
against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the \s-1SSL\s0
handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails.
Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or otherwise
invalid certificates.  This option forces an \*(L"insecure\*(R" mode of
operation that turns the certificate verification errors into warnings
and allows you to proceed.
.Sp
If you encounter \*(L"certificate verification\*(R" errors or ones saying
that \*(L"common name doesn't match requested host name\*(R", you can use
this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the download.
\&\fIOnly use this option if you are otherwise convinced of the
site's authenticity, or if you really don't care about the validity of
its certificate.\fR  It is almost always a bad idea not to check the
certificates when transmitting confidential or important data.

Use \fIfile\fR as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities
(\*(L"\s-1CA\s0\*(R") to verify the peers.  The certificates must be in \s-1PEM\s0 format.

Without this option Wget looks for \s-1CA\s0 certificates at the
system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.
.IP "\fB\-\-ca\-directory=\fR\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ca-directory=directory"
Specifies directory containing \s-1CA\s0 certificates in \s-1PEM\s0 format.  Each
file contains one \s-1CA\s0 certificate, and the file name is based on a hash
value derived from the certificate.  This is achieved by processing a
certificate directory with the \f(CW\*(C`c_rehash\*(C'\fR utility supplied with
OpenSSL.  Using \fB\-\-ca\-directory\fR is more efficient than
\&\fB\-\-ca\-certificate\fR when many certificates are installed because
it allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.

.IX Item "--random-file=file"
Use \fIfile\fR as the source of random data for seeding the
pseudo-random number generator on systems without \fI/dev/random\fR.
.Sp
On such systems the \s-1SSL\s0 library needs an external source of randomness
to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by \s-1EGD\s0 (see
\&\fB\-\-egd\-file\fR below) or read from an external source specified by
the user.  If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random data
in \f(CW$RANDFILE\fR or, if that is unset, in \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.rnd\fR.  If
none of those are available, it is likely that \s-1SSL\s0 encryption will not
be usable.
.Sp
If you're getting the \*(L"Could not seed OpenSSL \s-1PRNG\s0; disabling \s-1SSL\s0.\*(R" 
error, you should provide random data using some of the methods
described above.
.IP "\fB\-\-egd\-file=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--egd-file=file"
Use \fIfile\fR as the \s-1EGD\s0 socket.  \s-1EGD\s0 stands for \fIEntropy
Gathering Daemon\fR, a user-space program that collects data from
various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to other
programs that might need it.  Encryption software, such as the \s-1SSL\s0
library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed the random
number generator used to produce cryptographically strong keys.
.Sp
OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`RAND_FILE\*(C'\fR environment variable.  If this variable is unset, or
if the specified file does not produce enough randomness, OpenSSL will
read random data from \s-1EGD\s0 socket specified using this option.
.Sp
If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command is

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-remove\-listing\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-remove-listing"
Don't remove the temporary \fI.listing\fR files generated by \s-1FTP\s0
retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings
received from \s-1FTP\s0 servers.  Not removing them can be useful for
debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the
contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror
you're running is complete).
.Sp
Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this file,
this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
\&\fI.listing\fR a symbolic link to \fI/etc/passwd\fR or something and
asking \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on
the options used, either Wget will refuse to write to \fI.listing\fR,
making the globbing/recursion/time\-stamping operation fail, or the
symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
\&\fI.listing\fR file, or the listing will be written to a
\&\fI.listing.\fInumber\fI\fR file.
.Sp
Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR should
never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
something as simple as linking \fIindex.html\fR to \fI/etc/passwd\fR

will be overwritten.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-glob\fR" 4

Turn off \s-1FTP\s0 globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
special characters (\fIwildcards\fR), like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB[\fR
and \fB]\fR to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at
once, like:
.Sp
.Vb 1

By default, globbing will be turned on if the \s-1URL\s0 contains a
globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
permanently.
.Sp
You may have to quote the \s-1URL\s0 to protect it from being expanded by
your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing, which is
system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with Unix \s-1FTP\s0

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-passive\-ftp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-passive-ftp"
Disable the use of the \fIpassive\fR \s-1FTP\s0 transfer mode.  Passive \s-1FTP\s0
mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data
connection rather than the other way around.
.Sp
If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and
active \s-1FTP\s0 should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and \s-1NAT\s0
configurations passive \s-1FTP\s0 has a better chance of working.  However,
in some rare firewall configurations, active \s-1FTP\s0 actually works when
passive \s-1FTP\s0 doesn't.  If you suspect this to be the case, use this
option, or set \f(CW\*(C`passive_ftp=off\*(C'\fR in your init file.
.IP "\fB\-\-retr\-symlinks\fR" 4
.IX Item "--retr-symlinks"
Usually, when retrieving \s-1FTP\s0 directories recursively and a symbolic
link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.  Instead, a
matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem.  The
pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this recursive retrieval
would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.
.Sp
When \fB\-\-retr\-symlinks\fR is specified, however, symbolic links are
traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time, this
option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to directories and
recurse through them, but in the future it should be enhanced to do
this.
.Sp
Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to,
this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed in this
case.

.IP "\fB\-\-delete\-after\fR" 4
.IX Item "--delete-after"
This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
\&\fIafter\fR having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
pages through a proxy, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-nd \-\-delete\-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-r\fR option is to retrieve recursively, and \fB\-nd\fR to not
create directories.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-\-delete\-after\fR deletes files on the local machine.  It
does not issue the \fB\s-1DELE\s0\fR command to remote \s-1FTP\s0 sites, for
instance.  Also note that when \fB\-\-delete\-after\fR is specified,
\&\fB\-\-convert\-links\fR is ignored, so \fB.orig\fR files are simply not
created in the first place.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-convert\-links\fR" 4
.IX Item "--convert-links"
.PD
After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible
hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML
content, etc.
.Sp
Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
refer to the file they point to as a relative link.
.Sp
Example: if the downloaded file \fI/foo/doc.html\fR links to
\&\fI/bar/img.gif\fR, also downloaded, then the link in \fIdoc.html\fR
will be modified to point to \fB../bar/img.gif\fR.  This kind of
transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.
.Sp
Example: if the downloaded file \fI/foo/doc.html\fR links to
\&\fI/bar/img.gif\fR (or to \fI../bar/img.gif\fR), then the link in
\&\fIdoc.html\fR will be modified to point to
\&\fIhttp://\fIhostname\fI/bar/img.gif\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than
presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted
to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to
another directory.
.Sp
Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by \fB\-k\fR will be
performed at the end of all the downloads.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mirror"
.PD
Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion
and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps \s-1FTP\s0
directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to
\&\fB\-r \-N \-l inf \-\-no\-remove\-listing\fR.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-page\-requisites\fR" 4
.IX Item "--page-requisites"
.PD
This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to
properly display a given \s-1HTML\s0 page.  This includes such things as
inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
.Sp
Ordinarily, when downloading a single \s-1HTML\s0 page, any requisite documents
that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.  Using
\&\fB\-r\fR together with \fB\-l\fR can help, but since Wget does not
ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is
generally left with \*(L"leaf documents\*(R" that are missing their
requisites.
.Sp
For instance, say document \fI1.html\fR contains an \f(CW\*(C`<IMG>\*(C'\fR tag
referencing \fI1.gif\fR and an \f(CW\*(C`<A>\*(C'\fR tag pointing to external
document \fI2.html\fR.  Say that \fI2.html\fR is similar but that its
image is \fI2.gif\fR and it links to \fI3.html\fR.  Say this
continues up to some arbitrarily high number.
.Sp
If one executes the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 2 http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
then \fI1.html\fR, \fI1.gif\fR, \fI2.html\fR, \fI2.gif\fR, and
\&\fI3.html\fR will be downloaded.  As you can see, \fI3.html\fR is
without its requisite \fI3.gif\fR because Wget is simply counting the
number of hops (up to 2) away from \fI1.html\fR in order to determine
where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 2 \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
all the above files \fIand\fR \fI3.html\fR's requisite \fI3.gif\fR
will be downloaded.  Similarly,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 1 \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
will cause \fI1.html\fR, \fI1.gif\fR, \fI2.html\fR, and \fI2.gif\fR
to be downloaded.  One might think that:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 0 \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
would download just \fI1.html\fR and \fI1.gif\fR, but unfortunately
this is not the case, because \fB\-l 0\fR is equivalent to
\&\fB\-l inf\fR\-\-\-that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single \s-1HTML\s0
page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a
\&\fB\-i\fR \s-1URL\s0 input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
\&\fB\-r\fR and \fB\-l\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
Note that Wget will behave as if \fB\-r\fR had been specified, but only
that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that
page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download
a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate
websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
likes to use a few options in addition to \fB\-p\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-E \-H \-k \-K \-p http://<site>/<document>
.Ve
.Sp
To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
external document link is any \s-1URL\s0 specified in an \f(CW\*(C`<A>\*(C'\fR tag, an
\&\f(CW\*(C`<AREA>\*(C'\fR tag, or a \f(CW\*(C`<LINK>\*(C'\fR tag other than \f(CW\*(C`<LINK
REL="stylesheet">\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-strict\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "--strict-comments"
Turn on strict parsing of \s-1HTML\s0 comments.  The default is to terminate
comments at the first occurrence of \fB\-\->\fR.
.Sp
According to specifications, \s-1HTML\s0 comments are expressed as \s-1SGML\s0
\&\fIdeclarations\fR.  Declaration is special markup that begins with
\&\fB<!\fR and ends with \fB>\fR, such as \fB<!DOCTYPE ...>\fR, that
may contain comments between a pair of \fB\-\-\fR delimiters.  \s-1HTML\s0
comments are \*(L"empty declarations\*(R", \s-1SGML\s0 declarations without any
non-comment text.  Therefore, \fB<!\-\-foo\-\->\fR is a valid comment, and
so is \fB<!\-\-one\*(-- \-\-two\-\->\fR, but \fB<!\-\-1\-\-2\-\->\fR is not.
.Sp
On the other hand, most \s-1HTML\s0 writers don't perceive comments as anything
other than text delimited with \fB<!\-\-\fR and \fB\-\->\fR, which is not
quite the same.  For example, something like \fB<!\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\->\fR
works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple
of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next
\&\fB\-\-\fR, which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of
this, many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
\&\fB<!\-\-\fR and \fB\-\->\fR.
.Sp
Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in
missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had
the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments.  Beginning with
version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements
\&\*(L"naive\*(R" comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of
\&\fB\-\->\fR.
.Sp
If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
option to turn it on.

Wget will ignore all the \s-1FTP\s0 links.
.IP "\fB\-\-follow\-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--follow-tags=list"
Wget has an internal table of \s-1HTML\s0 tag / attribute pairs that it
considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
comma-separated \fIlist\fR with this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-tags=list"
This is the opposite of the \fB\-\-follow\-tags\fR option.  To skip
certain \s-1HTML\s0 tags when recursively looking for documents to download,
specify them in a comma-separated \fIlist\fR.
.Sp
In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a single page
and its requisites, using a command-line like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-\-ignore\-tags=a,area \-H \-k \-K \-r http://<site>/<document>
.Ve
.Sp
However, the author of this option came across a page with tags like
\&\f(CW\*(C`<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">\*(C'\fR and came to the realization that
specifying tags to ignore was not enough.  One can't just tell Wget to
ignore \f(CW\*(C`<LINK>\*(C'\fR, because then stylesheets will not be downloaded.
Now the best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites is the
dedicated \fB\-\-page\-requisites\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR" 4

Ignore case when matching files and directories.  This influences the

implemented when downloading from \s-1FTP\s0 sites.  For example, with this

You are welcome to submit bug reports via the \s-1GNU\s0 Wget bug tracker (see
<\fBhttp://wget.addictivecode.org/BugTracker\fR>).
.PP
Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.
.IP "1." 4
Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.  If
Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as documented,
it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way
they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to
double-check the documentation and the mailing lists.
.IP "2." 4
Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g. if
Wget crashes while downloading \fBwget \-rl0 \-kKE \-t5 \-\-no\-proxy
http://yoyodyne.com \-o /tmp/log\fR, you should try to see if the crash is
repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options.  You might
even try to start the download at the page where the crash occurred to
see if that page somehow triggered the crash.
.Sp
Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
\&\fI.wgetrc\fR file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably
a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats
with \fI.wgetrc\fR moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that
\&\fI.wgetrc\fR settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of
the file.
.IP "3." 4
Please start Wget with \fB\-d\fR option and send us the resulting
output (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled without
debug support, recompile it\-\-\-it is \fImuch\fR easier to trace bugs
with debug support on.
.Sp
Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information
from the debug log before sending it to the bug address.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR won't go out of its way to collect sensitive information,
but the log \fIwill\fR contain a fairly complete transcript of Wget's
communication with the server, which may include passwords and pieces
of downloaded data.  Since the bug address is publically archived, you
may assume that all bug reports are visible to the public.
.IP "4." 4
If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`gdb \`which
wget\` core\*(C'\fR and type \f(CW\*(C`where\*(C'\fR to get the backtrace.  This may not
work if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is
safe to try.
