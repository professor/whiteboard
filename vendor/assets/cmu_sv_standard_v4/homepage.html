                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>Silicon Valley is the epicenter of the software industry, and Carnegie Mellon University brings
                        its expertise in software education and research to the eco-system. The Software Systems and
                        Management Center (SSM) encompasses software systems technologies, software engineering methods,
                        and management techniques that improve the quality and delivery of modern software systems.&#160;In
                        a culture where products are shipped in weeks,&#160;we work quickly to find pragmatic solutions
                        to challenges faced by industry. &#160;</p>

                    <p>The Silicon Valley climate of innovation and entrepreneurship has a strong influence on our
                        research, resulting in an emphasis on projects that can be applied to real world problems rather
                        than purely focusing on foundational research. Our location puts us in close proximity to many
                        of the world's most innovative companies, and we have been able to draw on their top technical
                        leaders to present their work in our weekly colloquia.</p>

                    <p><span>Our primary focus is on mobile, embedded, and cloud computing systems. The teaching and research programs at the center reflect the unique character and software development style of Silicon Valley, making it an excellent home for students, faculty, and visitors who want to participate in our varied activities and connect with Silicon Valley. &#160;</span>
                    </p>

                    <h2><span>Graduate Programs</span></h2>

                    <p><span></span>The professional&#160;<a href="graduate-programs.html">masters programs</a>&#160;provide
                        our students with useful knowledge that they can quickly apply. Classes are project-based and
                        team-oriented. We follow a learning-by-doing model, supported by faculty coaching. In keeping
                        with the campus theme of &#8220;Developing Software Leaders,&#8221; the programs place a high
                        value on improving written and spoken communication skills as part of working on authentic
                        deliverables.</p>

                                href="http://repository.cmu.edu/silicon_valley/">repository</a>.&#160;Our faculty obtain
                        research grants, publish in leading conferences and archival journals, and bring their research
                        into the classroom.<span>&#160;</span>Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, our campus is
                        close to many of the world's most innovative companies. We draw on their top technical leaders
                        for colloquia, teaching and research.</p>
